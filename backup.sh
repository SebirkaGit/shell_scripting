# To run your backup.sh script, you'll need to follow these steps:

# 1. Make sure the script is executable
# First, ensure the script has execute permissions. If you havenâ€™t already, you can use the following command to make it executable:
# chmod +x backup.sh
# 2. Run the script
# Now, you can run the script by providing the source directory (the target directory to back up files from) and the destination directory (where the backup file will be moved to).

# The basic syntax for running the script is:
# ./backup.sh /path/to/source/directory /path/to/destination/directory
# Example:
# Assuming you want to back up files from /home/user/documents to /home/user/backups, you would run:
# ./backup.sh /home/user/documents /home/user/backups
# 3. Automating with cron (optional)
# If you want the script to run automatically every day (as per your original task), you can set up a cron job.

# To do that:

# Open the crontab configuration by typing:
# crontab -e
# Add a line to run the script daily. For example, to run it at 1 AM every day:
# 0 1 * * * /path/to/backup.sh /path/to/source/directory /path/to/destination/directory
# This will automatically execute the script every day at 1 AM.
